# Chatter

Let's learn some Elixir/Phoenix together.

## Requirements

* Elixir 1.7.4
* Erlang 21
* Nodejs

If you use `asdf`, you can just hit `asdf install` after you clone the repo and
should be good to go.

## Get started

Clone this repo, and do the following:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
* Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`

You can start the phoenix server with `mix phx.server`. Now you can visit
[`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
